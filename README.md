# So you want to be a developer
A zero-to-hero guide on navigating 21st century software development.

---

## Abstract
What programming language should I learn? How do I prepare for interviews? How do I do well in my internship?
These are all questions I've been asked time and time again by friends and strangers alike. 

The unfortunate truth that I've stumbled upon while going through my own maturation as a software developer is that **while there a great tutorials for any technology you can think of, there's very little advice on how to become a great developer in general.** What to learn [React](https://reactjs.org)? Great. Need good PR etiquette? [Here you go.](https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8) Knowing you need good PR etiquette in the first place? Well...

**This isn't and shouldn't be a guide on any specific thing. Rather, it should be a guide *to* those other guides. It's not how to learn, *it's what to learn.*** 

There's a lot more to being a good developer than simply knowing [insert_favorite_language_here].
